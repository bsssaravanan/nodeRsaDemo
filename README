THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD CODE.

When I was trying ot make node-rsa work, I felt that the instructions were a little bit
cryptic. It took way too much time for figure out the hyphenated argument structure,
ie, pkcs1-public.

Also, I'm not a huge expert in encryption stuff so it took way too long to figure out that
the key produced by ssh-keygen was wrong and what to do about fixing it.

So, when I got it working, I tuned this up for readability and put it in a repo so
that you can find it. It does three things. 

1) Encrypt with public key/decrypt with private key, both from files
2) Encrypt with private key/decrypt with private key, both from files
3) Generate keys to use for decryption and print them out

If you look closely, you will see the command to convert the .pub into a .pem,
ie, 

ssh-keygen -f keyName.pub -e -m pem > keyName.pem

You're welcome.

If you have any suggestions, improvements or elaborations, I'm happy to see them. Fork!!

Best,
